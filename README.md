# My Coding Practice ðŸŒ™

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little repo.
This is where I store all my exercises as I learn and grow through programming!

This repo is mostly for personal use â€” it helps me practice logic and problem-solving.

This repository **DOES NOT** have any projects. It is simply made to track my progress.

## ðŸ“– Where the exercises come from

Most of the exercises here come from:
- My college classes
- YouTube tutorials and free online courses

So this is it tyyy <333
